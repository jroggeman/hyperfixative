# Learning Commander

I've been somewhat interested in Magic since middle school, but for one reason or another, never really
got in to actually _playing with others_ until recently. I learned the basic mechanics way back then,
did one sealed constructed and one draft event in college, and beyond that, mostly just impulse bought
packs of the fancy shiny or alt art ones. One of the recent sets, [Bloomburrow](), caught my eye - it 
was nature-y and had cute critters - and I succumbed to the urge and got a box to crack and add to my
existing collection.

For whatever reason, though, for one of the first times, I'd actually started picking up more on the
game mechanics as well, finally, and not just buying expensive cardboard for the looks. My best guess
as to what actually motivated the interest was getting and playing the [Slay the Spire board game](bgg link).
In any event, I was already familiar with Commander being a popular and fairly casual format, so I
started watching videos and reading guides on building a commander deck for the first time. Putting
some basic learnings here.

## Deck Construction

### Goals
With Commander being such a broad format, folks have different goals when it comes to constructing
decks and playing games. Some folks are more in to solitaire, building up complex board
states and engines over the course of several turns with the hopes of swinging big in mid-to-late game.
Others prefer more interaction - responses to big plays, politics, and general mayhem. I tend to think
the latter is more interesting. The solitaire style is a neat form of puzzle solving that you can indeed
do alone, but to me magic and commander specifically are meant to be social and interactive, and I
really enjoy chaotic games :) So, my first goal is building a deck that is **interactive** - a deck that can respond to threats and answer plays from opponents.

I'd also like a deck that is reasonably focused, but isn't cEDH level or overly sweaty. From my 
admittedly limited experience so far, the general "meta" for casual Commander doesn't like playing with
land destruction and [stax][1]. I think it's a nuanced discussion - you can defend against both with
removal, mana dorks, etc, and it can be similar to creature/enchantment/artifact wipes. That said - I
think I agree that for a casual format, land wipes and stax are both somewhat difficult to recover from,
and each possible scenario you need to plan for is another card package you can't run in your deck. So
with that in mind, I'll **avoid land destruction and stax effects.**

In a similar vein, I can spend huge sums of money on cards like {{< autocard "Mana Vault" >}} or
{{< autocard "Urza's Saga" >}}, but those are generally prohibitively expensive for other casual
players. So I'd like to **avoid most expensive cards** to keep the game accessible for folks. A lot of
those cards also tend to ramp super quickly and lead to both snowballing and shorter games, neither of
which I really want. As an aside, these are generally staples in the competitive commander format
(cEDH), so could also just phrase this as no cEDH cards.

**tl;dr**:
- Interactive
- No major resource destruction or taxing
- No cEDH

### Rough Card Role Breakdown
A commander deck has 100 cards in it. There are a few broad roles we want to have a package of:
- Interaction - as mentioned in the goals, we want the deck to be responsive. That'll include both
  counterspells and protection for your own.
- Ramp - Rounds are slow in commander, with four folks playing at once. With one land per turn, it
  takes awhile to play cards. We also want to break parity and eventually be able to play cards in
  advance of the curve. So we'll run a set of cards that let us ramp - cards to put lands on the board
  in advance of curve, mana dorks, fetch lands for mana fixing, etc.
- Draw - Card draw offers big advantages in any game - more cards you can draw, more likelihood that
  you'll have the cards you need in a given scenario
